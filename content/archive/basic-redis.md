**Redis Basics and Node.js Integration**

Redis is an open-source, in-memory key-value data store known for its performance and versatility. It supports various data types, making it suitable for caching, real-time applications, pub/sub systems, and more.

In this guide, we'll cover:

- Redis Data Types
- Common Redis Commands
- How to integrate Redis into a Node.js project

---

# ðŸ“¦ Redis Data Types & Commands

Redis supports a variety of data structures:

## 1. Strings

Strings are the most basic Redis data type. You can store any type of value as a string, including integers and serialized JSON.

::code-block
---
files:
  - title: bash
    language: bash
    content: |
      SET name "Jay"
      GET name
      INCR counter
---
::

## 2. Lists
Lists are ordered collections of strings. You can add elements to the head or tail of the list.
::code-block
---
files:
  - title: bash
    language: bash
    content: |
      LPUSH mylist "apple"
      RPUSH mylist "banana"
      LRANGE mylist 0 -1
---
::

## 3. Sets
Sets are unordered collections of unique strings. They support operations like union, intersection, and difference.
::code-block
---
files:
  - title: bash
    language: bash
    content: |
      SADD myset "apple"
      SADD myset "banana"
      SADD myset "apple" # Duplicate, won't be added
      SMEMBERS myset
---
::

## 4. Hashes
Hashes are maps between string field and string values, making them ideal for representing objects.
::code-block
---
files:
  - title: bash
    language: bash
    content: |
      HSET user:1000 name "Jay" age 30
      HGETALL user:1000
---
::

## 5. Sorted Sets
Sorted sets are similar to sets but with a score associated with each member, allowing for ordered retrieval.
::code-block
---
files:
  - title: bash
    language: bash
    content: |
      ZADD mysortedset 1 "apple"
      ZADD mysortedset 2 "banana"
      ZRANGE mysortedset 0 -1
---
::

## 6. Bitmaps, HyperLogLogs, Streams
These are more advanced structures:
Bitmaps are used for bit-level operations, allowing you to manipulate individual bits within a string.

::code-block
---
files:
  - title: bash
    language: bash
    content: |
      SETBIT mybitmap 0 1
      SETBIT mybitmap 1 1
      BITCOUNT mybitmap
---
::

HyperLogLogs are used to estimate the cardinality (number of unique elements) of a set, making them useful for scenarios like tracking unique visitors.

::code-block
---
files:
  - title: bash
    language: bash
    content: |
      PFADD myhll "apple" "banana" "orange"
      PFCOUNT myhll
---
::

Streams are designed for real-time data pipelines and event sourcing, enabling you to append and query time-series data.

::code-block
---
files:
  - title: bash
    language: bash
    content: |
      XADD mystream * name "Jay" age 30
      XRANGE mystream - +
---

# ðŸ”§ Integrating Redis with Node.js
You can use the popular ioredis or redis client. Hereâ€™s an example with ioredis.

## 1. Install Redis and ioredis

::code-block
---
files:
  - title: bash
    language: bash
    content: |
      npm install ioredis
      # or
      yarn add ioredis
---
::

Make sure you have Redis installed and running. You can use Docker to run Redis easily:

::code-block
---
files:
  - title: bash
    language: bash
    content: |
      docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis
---
::

## 2. Basic Setup

Create a file named `redis.js` and add the following code:

::code-block
---
files:
  - title: redis.js
    language: javascript
    content: |
      // redis.ts
      import Redis from 'ioredis';

      const redis = new Redis({
        host: '127.0.0.1',
        port: 6379,
        // password: 'your_password_if_any'
      });

      export default redis;
---
::

## 3. Using Redis in Your Application
You can now use Redis in your application. Hereâ€™s an example of setting and getting a value:

::code-block
---
files:
  - title: example.js
    language: javascript
    content: |
      // example.ts
      import redis from './redis';

      // String
      await redis.set('greeting', 'Hello Redis');
      const greeting = await redis.get('greeting');
      console.log(greeting); // Hello Redis

      // List
      await redis.lpush('queue', 'task1');
      const task = await redis.rpop('queue');
      console.log(task); // task1

      // Hash
      await redis.hset('user:1', { name: 'Jay', role: 'admin' });
      const user = await redis.hgetall('user:1');
      console.log(user); // { name: 'Jay', role: 'admin' }

      // Sorted Set
      await redis.zadd('scores', 100, 'Jay');
      const scores = await redis.zrange('scores', 0, -1, 'WITHSCORES');
      console.log(scores);

      // Pub/Sub
      redis.subscribe('news');
      redis.on('message', (channel, message) => {
        console.log(`Received message from ${channel}: ${message}`);
      });

      const publisher = new Redis();
      publisher.publish('news', 'Breaking news!');
---
::


## 4. Caching Example
You can use Redis as a cache to store frequently accessed data. Hereâ€™s an example of caching a database query result:
::code-block
---
files:
  - title: cache.js
    language: javascript
    content: |
      import redis from './redis';

      async function getUserData(userId) {
        const cacheKey = `user:${userId}`;
        const cachedData = await redis.get(cacheKey);

        if (cachedData) {
          return JSON.parse(cachedData);
        }

        // Simulate a database query
        const userData = await queryDatabase(userId);
        await redis.set(cacheKey, JSON.stringify(userData), 'EX', 3600); // Cache for 1 hour
        return userData;
      }

      async function queryDatabase(userId) {
        // Simulate a database query
        return { id: userId, name: 'Jay', age: 30 };
      }
---
::
